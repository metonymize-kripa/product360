# Goal of the project

Help existing brands activate new opportunity spaces -- across digital retail platforms. 

**RETAIL DATA**: From Amazon, Walmart, Google, brand-com sites, search, ratings, and reviews

**ACTIVATED**: Combined with new algorithmic approaches

**FOR BRANDS**: Product developers, marketers and managers 

**TO GROW**: Drive stronger brand strategies to grow products faster, at a lower development cost with higher probabilities of success.

## Context

Retail in the US is going through the biggest shift since the adoption of the internet. 20% of consumer retail (excluding Automotive and Gasoline) will soon take place digitally.

The way products are developed, managed and marketed must make the most of this step change in the technology of retail. A new retail operating system is needed. Product 360 is our initial step towards building this system.

We are initially focused on helping existing brands develop new opportunity spaces faster, better, and for less. Implementing consumer software development practices like release management, rapid A/B user testing, version control, all in the context of cross-platform targeting (e.g. Amazon, Walmart, Costco).
