# Notes from interviews

## MK: April 8, 2021 // 3-5 Year Prediction is the hard problem

### VP of Innovation, $4B Beauty Brand
Focused on Retailers, e.g. Presented trends report to Walmart recently (they wanted to understand source of trend insights)

### Focused on upstream Vs marketing and downstream areas
Understanding voice of customer from reviews and other sources could be interesting

### Happy with Voice of Customer and Search trend tools
Not familiar with Data mechanics but a user of services from Signals, Reviews and Spate (Google Trends)

### Seeking to forecast trends 3-5 years out
Analysis of Patent and Research data could be helpful


## MM: April 9, 2021 // Deliver impact on share of spend/category

### Head of Global Marketing Innovation, Multibillion dollar Feminine Care
Decentralized and localized strategy. Easy to measure Vs. Right to measure.
What does success in innovation look like? (not just sales, market share, share of store, etc.)

### Big Data is not being used in innovation, more in media
Some social listening and commissioned studies. Tough to integrate with purchase data and voice of customer
(e.g. complaints line). None of this data is explictly fed back into Innovation Pipeline yet. An opportunity
to integrate and monitor more holistically to guide innovation priorities.

### Easy Vs Right innovation metrics
Easy: Net sales growth (Net incrementality that captures organic decline is better, but perhaps not enough)

Right: Household penetration rates, Share of store, Share of market, Share of category would be better.
A potentially quick win to loop in entitiative high velocity Commerce share data for closing the loop on competitive set faster.

### Longer term forecasting
Analysis of Patent and Research was done internally but found to be too labor intensive and inefficient.

### Trend spotting and understanding
How are customers thinking about themes like "sustainability" in Brazil, UK, China, etc.?

### Opportunities to reduce cost of testing
Can consumer complaints, reviews and other past data be activated to reduce cost of "home use" and product testing?
To create a better model of the "ecoverse" Who, What, Why, etc. to get early reads on reaction for innovation efforts

## LS: April 9, 2021 // Make the overwhelming amount of it actionable

### Head of Marketing, Consumer facing medical technology company
"We are not using Big Data as much as we should for innovation"

### Use Big Data to help us do more with less, faster
There are large gaps between pools of data available and simple ways to action them. For example:
- Understand how to engage customers more efficiently. Advertise less or more effectively (not elaborated)
- How to use social viewing and engagement data to catch trends in clothing, design, etc.
- There are so many "orphan drugs" that can be activated via DNA testing

### Opportunity to synthesize Big Data is vast
Companies like Helium are making solid progress in this space.

### Opportunity to identify competitive set and potential collaborators at scale
Using eCommerce data analysis, it is possible to create new market, competition and collaboration maps.
Enabling more creative marketing and partnership tactics by processing this data better.

### The human factors should not be forgotten
Simple interventions like "using the pace of ambient music to make plane boarding more efficient" 
can be sought out and implemented using some of the advances in data signal processing as well

## TN: April 9, 2021 // Abduction for the non obvious is whats missing

### Head of Innovation, Billion dollar Brand in beverage category
Attempts to use Big Data for innovation have not yielded great results. Much more effective in 
performance marketing and media optimization.

### Augmenting the process using virtual focus groups and creative idea generation
Fast following a trend is great, but results from using analytics for real innovation have not been great. Tools like virtual focus groups (across 100 panelists using web tech)
or image analysis tools that help generate new ideas are promising, but in the early stages.

### Abduction is the opportunity ahead
Much of the tools today focus on incremental tuning of media spend and performance marketing. The big prize is ahead:
- He pointed out ('abductive reasoning') the Achilles heel of current ML methods, namely the ability to abstract
- Accelerating design thinking:  here ML could help, e.g. based on the active learning ideas, i.e. focusing on the most difficult boundary cases to get the direction of what to do next. 

### Large Brands will struggle to incorporate fast moving and granular user signals
The ability to move the needle on a multibillion dollar Brand is limited. Much of the analytics
in these cases goes to justify capital spending in the base business and market segments.
However, small brands producing long tail products might benefit, moving niche to mainstream based on data for tactical growth at scale

## AK: April 14, 2021 // Sustaining incremental innovation is the spot for Big Data

### Director of Marketing, Fast Growing Brand in Beauty/Skin 
Founder led Brand with more than 2X annual growth, starting to formalize marketing and innovation planning

### Innovation approach so far has been more push than pull
Driven by the deep insights from team's first hand customer experience and industry expertise.
Cost of data and relative lack of coverage in the DTC space has been a deterrant to use Big Data so far.

### Experiments in trend spotting have been promising
Using experts and data together, reaching for 5-10 year trends is a tough but important problem.
But this needs to be managed to drive action. Additional areas of focus: capture empotion, mood, sentiment along with hard data.

### Big Data could be useful to sustain incremental innovation Vs disruptive new ideas
Often there are unmet needs that are also undescribable because consumer doesn't yet know something new and disruptive is possible.
To use data for disruptive innovation is much harder

### The notion of competitive insight mining and search pathways mapping was exciting
Reaction to example dashboards shared for both need and placement analysis using Amazon data were positive

## MS: April 20, 2021 // Engage community, fast follow and then offer the best

### Senior Innovation Executive, Billion dollar specialty beauty brand
Established history in the category with large power SKUs has made quick, small brand innovation less of a priority.

### Innovation spotted by seeing fast growing competitors with novel offerings
Big Data is not generally used for innovation. Reports from companies like Mintel and competitive analysis is a more important soure.
Some Google trend analysis has helped reposition messaging of ingredients that are on trend, to help make more resonant claims.

### Better community engagement: Social listening, ratings and reviews, voice of customer
Big Data and associated tools would help better engage customers and address areas of concern or interest, faster and better.

## FM: April 26, 2021 // Go beyond obvious, with "fast data" prediction

### Senior Marketing Executive, Multibillion dollar CPG
Over a decade at global CPG. Now focused on the front end of innovation, as part of ventures work, beyond incremental development.
Interested in the Megatrends around the world. Also, interested in the applications of AI & ML to the problem.

### Several sources of Big Data available, not as easy to access them in an integrated form for action
Several teams work with individual trend agencies. Reports/studies bought online. Data from Nielsen (e.g. Bases) is often used as well.

### Speed at which market now moves makes recent data driven forecasts more important but harder to do
Using 5 years worth of aggregated data is a problem in forecasting. Especially when the last year's worth of data probably captures the real new signal.

### Unarticulated gaps: How to identify tangential connections outside of core capabilities? 
What do customers do Vs What they say they want? All the things the shopper is searching for beyond the current product, but related, in some problem-driven way.
