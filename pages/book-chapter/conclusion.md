# Conclusion: Big Data enables smarter, faster and cheaper test & learn

In this article, we discuss the use of innovation analytics in product evolution and marketing, focusing on the consumer sectors. We propose a Big Data enabled model in which analytics drives practical innovation by allowing companies to better respond to customer needs, especially when focusing on introducing new products. We also discuss some of the new techniques such as causal modeling. Through the interview with innovation executives, we address the process of making analytics operational. Integration of data across siloes to quantify trends and response for impact. 

To recap, what then are the key contributions of this work?
-	Introducing new networked architectures to model the process of
innovation
-	Offer examples of innovation vs. invention (what shoppers want and where the market is going; data driven vs. aspirational, if you say shoppers want it, tell us where’s data)
-	Identify new areas of opportunity to monetize data
-	Introduce use cases for newer technologies, e.g. NFL using NLP — practitioners point of view
-	Catalogue important relevant technologies for further test and
exploration
