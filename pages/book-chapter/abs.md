# Abstract: Big Data's promise for Consumer Innovation

The exponential increase in consumer behavior and product marketing data, has not led to a corresponding increase in innovative output at leading CPG companies. A number of practical barriers remain, including limited inhouse Data Science talent, siloed data sources, mismatch in timescales between product development with rapidly changing consumer trends, and lack of integrated eCommerce and Web/Social insight mining capabilities.

On the other hand many promising advances in machine learning, e.g. Natural Language Processing and Third Wave AI, can help accelerate the convenient use of exponential consumer data for quicker and more efficient innovation.

Using a combination of web surveys and face to face interviews, this work has identified practical concerns of leading Innovation Executives and their recommendations for technologists e.g. longterm trend prediction, link more directly to sales/share metrics, go beyond incremental performance marketing to more creative use cases.

Responding to practitioner needs, we offer a survey of the most promising tools and areas of technology and illustrative case studies with technical references. Starting with practical problems in mind, this work offers consumer business leaders a glimpse of the art of the possible. With easy to apply examples of how AI-enabled tools and processes can help synthesize and mine eCommerce/Web/Social data for smarter, faster and more efficient growth and innovation.
