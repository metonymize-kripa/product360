# Practitioner's View: Lots of kindling waiting for a spark

While Big Data usage is common for go-to-market plans, our team sought to understand to what extent Big Data is being used to shape upstream innovation from Front End, disruptive innovation down to sustaining innovation. We engaged practitioners in the space who are actively leading innovation portfolios – including responsibilities across strategic “where to play” choice, in-house consumer and market understanding and project scope. Our panelists serve across a variety of CPG categories industries from food and beverage and shave care to do-it-yourself DNA test kits and paper products.

## Innovator Unmet Needs
We learned several key items when we asked practitioners which 3 key challenges they would prioritize for their innovation programs.  Surprisingly, they did not seek to mine the data of competitors, to bring analytics in-house or to integrate data from disparate sources such as Walmart and Amazon. Rather, their key challenges focused on 1) Defining unmet shopper needs, 2) Leveraging 3rd wave analytics to predict opportunities and to forecast trends and 3) to model the relative size of potential opportunities or ideas.

When we explored these unmet needs further, our respondents began to stitch together the challenge of managing both risk and the size of their innovation portfolio based on the level of disruption they were pursing with their portfolio and the time horizon to bring the new products to market.  For instance, the bigger the capital investment, the R&D investment, the breakthrough nature of category innovation or the more competitive the category, the more value predictive analytics would offer.

## Use of Big Data Today

Manipulating big data to create algorithms that optimize Brand plans is not new.  Google, Facebook and Amazon spawned a $336B digital advertising industry built by leveraging 1st and 3rd party consumer behavioral data to form algorithm-based platforms that let advertisers address ads to potential customers based on increasingly predictive behavioral data.  With Amazon Advertising, advertisers can target ads to customers based on viewing or purchase data down to a SKU-level or a certain time window, and the Amazon Demand Side Platform (DSP) system will even enable Marketers to auto-optimize campaigns through targeting, placement or even the creative served to maximize the return on advertising investment against various campaign goals.
Similarly, trigger marketing or event-driven marketing represents a form of marketing that relies on the mining and modeling of important events within the customer lifecycle to define not only the WHO to target, but WHAT content and WHEN to serve marketing efforts that drive awareness, consideration or conversion and will deliver the highest performance of a campaign.  In the past 5 years advancements in data mining and modeling as well as the creation of systems to capture events and automate campaigns have set the stage for widespread adoption of these tools throughout the marketing funnel.  LinkedIn estimates that trigger-based e-mail campaigns have 5X the response rate of non-triggered push campaigns, and the effects can be seen across other forms of marketing from social and chatbots to phone calls.
Marketers have adopted Big Data for downstream purposes (go to market plans) in large part because companies like Google, Amazon, Walmart, Facebook, Target, Shopify, LinkedIn and others have intentionally created B2B monetization models which are built around the generation and access to this intuitively predictive data.  They are selling a combined service package not only the data and analytics, but insight generation, plug & play application (e.g. systems to buy media) and most importantly, measurement.   While the tools are not all perfect, Marketeers have been able to quantify the value of these “performance marketing,” which has driven the rapid shift of funding (add data).

While we interviewed a concentration of panelists from companies with annual sales of over $1.0B USD, we were surprised to learn that qualitatively, 75% of companies are outsourcing data analytics.

Key barriers include access to data, modeling expertise, and competing resource needs to survive in the fragmented, omni-channel world where barriers to entry have evaporated for many companies. Today, our panelists report that they are sourcing data from a variety of places to guide their innovation strategies including the following:

However, when we probed the extent to which big data is being used to guide innovation choices, almost all panelists, even from some of the largest CPG companies, felt they were “behind” the industry.  They reported widespread use of algorithms to shape their downstream Marketing plans, but were using predominantly purchase data, 3rd party trend reports and small data consumer research to determine innovation strategies and plans.

## Key Drivers of Big Data Perceptions and Needs

- Levels of Disruption:  The innovators we spoke to classified their innovation plans into 4 common buckets and leveraged this framework to help define their needs and where potential Big Data analyses could be impactful:
- Commercial Innovation: The repositioning of existing products to drive top or bottom line growth with little to no invention required;  This could include things like a new claim or new commercialization, a shift in artwork to enable cheaper printing of labels, etc.
- Sustaining Innovation:  In this capacity, brands innovate product, benefit, component or manufacturing lines using existing capabilities and existing markets.  This could include things like new scents or flavors, more ergonomic packaging, new & improved formulas and claims. 
- Breakthrough Innovation: This type of innovation changes to an existing product, service, channel or process that create a significant impact on the business. For example, it could open up a new consumer category for the business, or change the way existing customers interact, buy or use the brand
- Disruptive Innovation: HBS professor Clayton Christensen developed the theory of disruptive innovation that changes the basis of competition. These new products or services enter at the bottom of the market or in new market footholds and overtime move up and displace established market leaders, gaining mainstream appeal over time.
- Time Horizon: New products for CPG brands typically take  6 month to 5-years to bring to market. Most new product innovations require safety and regulatory work, formulation and packaging design, adaptations of manufacturing lines and the creation of inventory to flow out into the omni channel.  There are infrequent exceptions that leverage existing formulas, packaging and manufacturing to enable speed while more disruptive inventions, such as connected products, those requiring multiple inventions or those requiring new manufacturing capability can require even longer lead times.
- Data Source Fluency:  While our survey findings indicate respondents are using analytics to shape their strategies, few of the respondents we spoke to could volunteer mineable  primary text data sources. They repeatedly mentioned importing analyses from suppliers such as IRI, Nielsen and trend firms or, in some cases, deferring to internal market research teams.  Because of this
