# Methodology: Connect practitioner's view to state of art technology

The practical work of this project includes:

- Interviews with marketers and product innovators from consumer product manufacturing companies at the forefront of using data for innovation in R&D and marketing
- Case studies from Metonymize client work and those of other firms using AI to accelerate consumer product innovation
  - Insight mining tools to model customer needs and behavior
  - Competitor and technology data mining to shape R&D and product development
  - Digital marketing innovation (e.g. Amazon, Google) to efficiently reach the right shopper
- Summarize tradeoffs implicit in Network Innovation Vs Invention and catalog technologies that help
  - Our premise, is that success in networked innovation is driven disproportionately by the identification and framing of important problem areas, of immediate value to customers/users
  - Along these lines, we introduce, with references, a handful of technical advances applicable to Consumer Innovation
