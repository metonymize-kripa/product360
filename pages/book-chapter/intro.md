# Introduction: Integration for impact remains the open problem


Innovation is on everyone’s mind, as shown in in Fig. 1, even more than artificial intelligence, big data, and deep learning.

Figure 1: Sustained relative interest in Innovation shows e.g. in Google ngrams Vs concepts like Big Data [HERE](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=innovation%2Cartificial+intelligence%2Cbig+data%2Cmachine+learning&year+start=1900&year+end=2019&corpus=26&smoothing=3&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cinnovation%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cartificial%20intelligence%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cbig%20data%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cmachine%20learning%3B%2Cc0")

Obviously innovation is culture dependent, for nation scale innovation see e.g. [Kottak, 1990], for enterprise innovation see [By Udo Kopka & Patrick Simon, 2020, Kristin Behrmann, 2019].
Moreover, innovation is also a process of adaptation [George & Lin, 2017], a common feature not only of the artificial world [Simon, 2019], but also of the natural world, and as such subject to investigations resulting in finding relevant ‘laws’ [Lamsdell & Braddy, 2010].
Notwithstanding this broader context, in the core of this article, by innovation we mean a product cycle ending with new product launch. To focus further, we will only talk about consumer product innovation. And we explicitly exclude other types of innovation: service innovation, medicines, software and platforms innovation, etc. Offering insights and a real-world framework to leverage Innovation Analytics for Competitive Advantage, from New Product Development to Operations. Enabling business models to experiment, test and learn – faster, cheaper and smarter – by building core competency in an emerging area of Innovation Analytics.

Innovation analytics can be defined as the use of data to enable the design and marketing of new products and services. By consumer innovation we mean a development cycle ending in a new consumer product launch. Focused particularly on advancement in the context of an exponential growth in consumer behavioral and marketing performance data via adoption of networked digital commerce, search and communication platforms (e.g. Amazon, Google, Facebook).

## The Problem: Speed (of test-learn, adaptation, ideation, and data-integration)

Product introduction and adoption is faster than ever, which also means that product obsolescence is accelerating.

- Product cycle times are dramatically shorter than they were 20 years ago [Driggs & Larry Levin, 2020]
- Revenue contribution from new consumer products is steadily increas- ing, at faster rates [Driggs & Larry Levin, 2020, Services, Nov 11 2020]
- Data mining of competitive, behavioral and search data on the large and fast growing platforms are an important source of practical innova- tion and testing capabilities [Leskovec et al., 2020, Moe & Schweidel, 2012]

## A model for consumer innovation

How do we find out what customers might be looking for? How do present our products to the customers most likely to adopt them? Obviously, search and analytics are part of the solution, and we discuss a few examples technologies in this space (NLP, causal Bayesian analysis, etc.).

Less clearly we see what is emerging in this space. Nevertheless, we point to a few possibilities (image and video mining, mining of mini networks, e.g. small networks on Pinterest or TikTok).
The idea of using graphs as models of business activity is not new, even the tripartite graphs have been used before, e.g. to model recommendation networks [Kim et al., 2019]. The particular model we are proposing func- tions as a model of innovation, as it allows us to use searches as evidence for ongoing product innovation and for product gaps.
